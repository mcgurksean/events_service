# Events as a Service

I have created an events service that allows the user to:

* Send an event in the form of an HTTP POST that takes a name, and a timestamp 

* Query the events in a time range returning the name of the event, and the count of events in the time range 

An example API Recording an event:

###POST /events
```
{
"name": "checkout",
"timestamp": "2015-02-11T15:01:00+00:00"
}
```

###Aggregating events

```
GET /events/count?from=2015-02-11T15:01:00+00:00&to=2015-02-11T15:01:00+00:00
{
"checkout": 30
}
```

N.B. The request *MUST* be submitted in valid json format.

Not sure if your request is in valid Json format? You can check it here: http://jsonlint.com/


## Running the Events Service

`go build events_service.go`

In order to run the events service, run the following command after you have built the service:

`./events_service`


## Testing the Events Service

In order to test the events service, run the following command:

`go test events_service_test.go`


## Building the Docker Image with Dockerfile

To build the Docker image by reading instructions from Dockerfile, run the following command:

`sudo docker build -t golang-docker .`


## Running the Docker Image

To run the Docker image by publishing an external port (e.g. 3000) to the docker container’s port 8080, run the following command:

`docker run —publish 3000:8080 —name goweb —rm golang-docker`
